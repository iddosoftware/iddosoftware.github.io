**About Us**
Iddo Software is currently comprised of myself and Ștefan Ghivirigă. We're, basically, a couple of guys in a basement office writing computer vision and deep learning code for startups that need our skills to build their apps.

**What we do**
As I've stated above, we're (mostly) writing code. Many computer vision and machine learning apps share common functionality, so we strongly incentivize our clients (through substantial discounts to our own hourly rates) to allow us to reuse the code we write for them. This way, we don't write the same stuff over and over again (which leads to boredom and depression), and our clients get their code faster and cheaper.

We also have a network of other machine learning and computer vision engineers which we might be able to get on board if necessary, and other developers that can help us out with things like DevOps, web dev, mobile dev, sys admin and others.

### What we want
We want to grow. We have a strong predilection towards stability and, hence, we value long term commitments from our clients. Reciprocally, we offer long term commitments to our clients in return. As such, we usually prefer, e.g., hiring new developers for new clients as opposed over switching from one customer to the next. We also like to put our money where our mouth is, so we generally offer a significant discount for long-term contracts with the clients we already have a good history with.

### What we've done
As you can see, we don't have a proper portfolio web page yet, since we've been pretty busy doing what we do best for our clients, namely writing computer vision and deep learning code. We're actually working on the portfolio, but it's not ready yet. However, in the mean time, you can get a grip of what we've done until now by taking a look at our LinkedIn profiles. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbudescu/) is mine, and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-ghiviriga-93818913a/) is Ștefan's.

### What we can do
As you can find out if you browse our profiles, we're experienced with projects involving:
- mapping objects in images to their positions in the real world
- classifying, locating, segmenting and recognizing objects in images, mostly (but not only) using neural nets
- designing, training and deploying neural nets for the above purposes, and some others, too (e.g., improving video quality)

We're also used to having to read a lot (research). This way we've been able to tackle a large variety of projects, as you can see in our CVs.

**Note:** at some point I took the time to write everything I could remember having used, in terms of tech, on my personal blog. It's a lengthy (and rather boring) read, but if you want you can access it here.

### What we use
Over time, we've used several technologies (programming languages, libraries, frameworks etc.) to build the stuff we've built, and, in the process, we've grown more or less accustomed to some of them:
- Computer Vision: `OpenCV` (from both `Python` and `C++`), `mahotas`, `scikit-image`, `scipy.ndimage`
- Deep Learning: `TensorFlow` (`Python` for training & inference, `C` and `Java` for inference only), `Keras`, `HyperOpt`, `scikit-learn`, `Caffe` (`C++`, `Python`), `Theano`, `pylearn2` (really old framework)
- deployment: `Docker`, `OpenAPI`, `pipenv`
- generic data processing: `NumPy`
- statistics: `pandas`, `scipy.stats`, `statsmodels`
- data visualization: `matplotlib` (+`mpld3`), `seaborn`, `plotly`
- GUI: `Qt` for `Python` (`PyQt5`, `PyQt4`, `PySide`)

### What we have
We own some hardware for training and deploying neural nets and there should be more coming.
